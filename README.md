# Roox - Lingua
Translate your entities and their components into several languages to make your application multilingual.

This plugin module currently supports the translation of:
* Entity attributes (name, menu title, window heading, listing heading, insert button title)
* Comment attributes (window heading, listing heading, insert button title)
* Field attributes (long/short name, tooltip)
* Form tabs (name, description)
* Menu
* Global lists
* Field choices

Translation will be visible in menu, listing page (table), info page, and form.

How to install:
* This module requires [Roox Core](https://github.com/eddydeniro/roox-core). If you have installed it, just download the zip file of this module.
* Go to setting page of **Roox Core** and follow the instruction in the _Module Installer_ section.

How to use:
* Open Roox > Lingua page, you will see two navigation menu: Entity Configuration and Menu Configuration
* Choose the target language. Please note, you cannot translate into the same language as your application language setting.
* In every section, you will see a table of attributes that can be translated. To start translating, just type in the table cells directly and save your work.

Please note that Lingua will not allow to translate into the same language as in your application configuration. 

So for the sake of consistency, always design your application (entities, fields, global lists, etc.) in the language defined in your application configuration and translate them afterwards. 

Compatibility: Rukovoditel 3.5.3
